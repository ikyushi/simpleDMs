# simpleDMs Roadmap

A comprehensive guide to where I think [simpleDMs](https://github.com/simplesentai/simpleDMs) is going (more or less).
This "roadmap" will be updated from time-to-time, provided I actually work on this project more than I work on other projects (like a ***VISUAL NOVEL*** (hint hint))

To stay updated on where simpleDMs is going, be sure to occasionally check this file. Updates will most likely be overwritten when pushed, but if they're not,
there will be (date/time)stamps.

Be sure to star / watch the repository to know when cool stuff happens (in reference to the [actual list](#actual-roadmap)!

# actual roadmap
